## Features
* Rule implementation of the Living Rulebook 5 with the following limitations:
  * Only skills for the Human and Orc teams have been implemented and tested
  * No big guys
  * No league or tournament play
  * No star player points or level up
  * No inducements
  * No timers; Players have unlimited time each turn
* A web interface supporting:
  * Hot-seat
  * Online play
  * Spectators
  * Human vs. bot
* An AI interface that allows you to implement and test your own bots
  * Path finding utilities
  * Examples to get started
* Implementation of the Open AI Gym interface, that allows you to train machine learning algorithms
* Custom pitches (we call these _arenas_). FFAI comes with arenas of four different sizes.
* Rule configurations are possible from a configuration file, including:
  * Arena (which .txt file to load describing the arena)
  * Ruleset (which .xml file to load containing rules for rosters etc.)
  * Setup restrictions
  * Number of turns
  * Kick-off table enabled/disabled
  * Which scatter dice to use
  * ...
* Premade formations to ease the setup phase. Custom made formations can easily be implemented.
* Games can be saved and loaded

## Plans for Future Releases
* More documentation
* AI tournament module
* Support for dungeon arenas
* Support for all skills and teams in LRB6
* League mode
* Integration with OBBLM

## Installation
[Make sure python 3.6 or newer is installed, together with pip.](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-pip-for-python/)
```
pip install git+https://github.com/njustesen/ffai
```

## Run FFAI's Web Server
```
python examples/server_example.py
```
Go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

The main page lists active games. For each active game you can click on a team to play it. If a team is disabled it is controlled by a bot and cannot be selected. Click hot-seat to play human vs. human on the same machine.

## Create a Bot
To make you own bot you must implement the Agent class and its three methods: new_game, act, and end_game which are called by the framework. The act method must return an instance of the Action class.

Take a look at our [bot_example.py](examples/bot_example.py).

Be aware, that you shouldn't modify instances that comes from the framework such as Square instances as these are shared with the GameState instance in FFAI. In future releases, we plan to release an AI tournament module that will clone the instances before they are handed to the bots. For now, this is up to the user to do.

## Gym Interface
FFAI implements the Open AI Gym interace for easy integration of machine learning algorithms.

Take a look at our [gym_example.py](examples/gym_example.py).

### Observations
Observations are split in three parts:
1. 'board': two-dimensional feature leayers
2. 'state': a vector of normalized values (e.g. turn number, half, scores etc.) describing the game state
3. 'procedure' a one-hot vector describing which of 18 procedures the game is in. The game engine is structered as a stack of procedures. The top-most procedure in the stack is active.

#### Observation: 'board'
The default feature layers in obs['board'] are:

0. OccupiedLayer()
1. OwnPlayerLayer()
2. OppPlayerLayer()
3. OwnTackleZoneLayer()
4. OppTackleZoneLayer()
5. UpLayer()
6. UsedLayer()
7. AvailablePlayerLayer()
8. AvailablePositionLayer()
9. RollProbabilityLayer()
10. BlockDiceLayer()
11. ActivePlayerLayer()
12. TargetPlayerLayer()
13. MALayer()
14. STLayer()
15. AGLayer()
16. AVLayer()
17. MovemenLeftLayer()
18. BallLayer()
19. OwnHalfLayer()
20. OwnTouchdownLayer()
21. OppTouchdownLayer()
22. SkillLayer(Skill.BLOCK)
23. SkillLayer(Skill.DODGE)
24. SkillLayer(Skill.SURE_HANDS)
25. SkillLayer(Skill.PASS)

Custom layers can be implemented like this:
```
from ffai.ai import FeatureLayer
class MyCustomLayer(FeatureLayer):

    def produce(self, game):
        out = np.zeros((game.arena.height, game.arena.width))
        for y in range(len(game.state.pitch.board)):
            for x in range(len(game.state.pitch.board[0])):
                player = game.state.pitch.board[y][x]
                out[y][x] = 1.0 if player is not None and player.role.cost > 80000 else 0.0
        return out

    def name(self):
        return "expensive players"
```
and added to the environment's feature layers:
```
env.layers.append(MyCustomLayer())
```

To visualize the feature layers, use the feature_layers option when calling render:
```
env.render(feature_layers=True)
```

0. ActionType.START_GAME
1. ActionType.HEADS
2. ActionType.TAILS
3. ActionType.KICK

8. ActionType.END_TURN
9. ActionType.STAND_UP
10. ActionType.SELECT_ATTACKER_DOWN
11. ActionType.SELECT_BOTH_DOWN
12. ActionType.SELECT_PUSH
13. ActionType.SELECT_DEFENDER_STUMBLES
14. ActionType.SELECT_DEFENDER_DOWN
15. ActionType.SELECT_NONE
16. ActionType.PLACE_PLAYER<Position> (Only used during high-kick)
17. ActionType.PLACE_BALL<Position>
18. ActionType.PUSH<Position>
19. ActionType.FOLLOW_UP<Position>
20. ActionType.INTERCEPTION<Position>
21. ActionType.SELECT_PLAYER<Position>
22. ActionType.MOVE<Position>
23. ActionType.BLOCK<Position>
24. ActionType.PASS<Position>
25. ActionType.FOUL<Position>
26. ActionType.HANDOFF<Position>
27. ActionType.SETUP_FORMATION_WEDGE
28. ActionType.SETUP_FORMATION_LINE
29. ActionType.SETUP_FORMATION_SPREAD
30. ActionType.SETUP_FORMATION_ZONE

Actions are instantiated and used like this:
```
action = {
    'action-type': 26,
    'x': 8,
    'y': 6
}
obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
```

### Rewards and Info
The default reward function only rewards for a win, draw or loss 1/0/-1.
However, the info object returned by the step function contains useful information for reward shaping:
```
'cas_inflicted': {int},
'opp_cas_inflicted': {int},
'touchdowns': {int},
'opp_touchdowns': {int},
'half': {int},
'round': {int}
```
These values are commulative, such that 'cas_inflicted' referes to the total number of casualties inflicted by the team.

### Variants
FFAI comes with four environments with various difficulty:
* FFAI-v1: 11 players on a 26x15 pitch (traditional size)
* FFAI-v1-7: 7 players on a 20x11 pitch
* FFAI-v1-5: 5 players on a 16x8 pitch
* FFAI-v1-3: 3 players on a 12x5 pitch

This is how the FFAI-v1-3 environment looks:
